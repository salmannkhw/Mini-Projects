# Mini-Projects
Here are some mini projects I made while learning Java

1. Quiz.java: Quiz (Theme: Harry Potter) of 10 questions within 100 lines of code, which tracks scoring: +2 for a correct answer and -1 for an incorrect one.
2. Hangman.Java: Single-player Hangman game that also draws Hangman in ASCII art.
